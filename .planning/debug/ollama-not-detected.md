# Debug: Ollama not detected in onboarding (Step 3)

## Symptoms

- **Expected:** On the onboarding `ollama` screen, with Ollama installed and the daemon running, detection reports the engine found/running and unblocks Continue.
- **Actual:** Screen shows "Ollama engine — not found" + status "Not running"; Continue stays disabled. Re-check does not flip it.
- **Error/on-screen:** ollama-screen "not found" (onboarding.js:504) + "Not running" pill (onboarding.js:505) — BOTH are driven by the single boolean `state.ollamaDetected = !!getModelStatus().serverUp` (onboarding.js:492-493), gated by `canAdvance()` (onboarding.js:165). (The `:271` "not found" is the unrelated whisper screen.)
- **Timeline:** First run of the Phase-3 local-engine onboarding (new feature, 03-06). Never worked on this machine.
- **Reproduction:** Launch via `npm start` (dev Electron), reach Step 3 with Ollama installed + daemon running on 127.0.0.1:11434, click Re-check → still "not found / Not running".
- **Environment:** macOS Darwin 25.5 (Apple Silicon arm64), Ollama 0.32.0, launched via `npm start`. `ollama` on shell PATH at `/opt/homebrew/bin/ollama` and `/usr/local/bin/ollama`.

## Current Focus

- REOPENED 2026-07-14T23:xx — prior fix (commit 2628f8a) was NECESSARY BUT INSUFFICIENT; real app STILL reported serverUp:false after a clean restart. DEEPER root cause found + PROVEN below (Azure browser-DOM polyfill pollutes `global.URL` process-wide).
- deeper_root_cause (CONFIRMED, network-free): `main.js` top-level `require("./src/services/speech.service")` runs the Azure Speech SDK browser-DOM shim, which REPLACES `global.URL` (+ window/document/navigator/…) with a FAKE URL class that parses ANY input to `{ hostname:'localhost', port:'', protocol:'https:' }` and has NO `searchParams` (speech.service.js:293-308, 354). Every `new URL()` in the process is then poisoned. This breaks THREE local-engine consumers: (1) `_probeVersion` — prior fix used `new URL(this.host)` on the poisoned global → probeHttp targets localhost:443, not 127.0.0.1:11434 → serverUp:false; (2) the openai SDK's internal `buildURL` does `Object.fromEntries(url.searchParams)` → THROWS on the fake URL (this is exactly the "browser-like environment" pre-throw AND, once dangerouslyAllowBrowser is set, a searchParams TypeError); (3) the ollama client's `formatHost` mangles host → `https://localhost:443…`. PLUS the openai constructor throws "It looks like you're running in a browser-like environment" because the polyfill sets window+document+navigator (openai isRunningInBrowser triad) — observed in ~/.OpenCluely/logs/error-2026-07-14.log on EVERY run (100% of LOCAL errors), so the client never even initialized (isInitialized:false → cannot answer).
- fix (IMPLEMENTED, see Resolution): new `src/core/local-transport.js` (native URL + `ensureNativeGlobalURL()` global-URL repair + `nodeFetch` Node-http WHATWG transport). Manager: `new URL` from node:url in `_probeVersion`, repair global URL + pass `nodeFetch` to the ollama client, guard `getStatus()`. Provider: repair global URL + `dangerouslyAllowBrowser:true` + `nodeFetch` transport. Polyfill left intact (Phase 4 / STT-05 owns removal).
- next_action: DONE — RED tests confirmed failing pre-fix, GREEN post-fix; both whole-repo gates green; committed atomically (7b4a48a). Session-manager REOPEN-2 check PASSED under the REAL polyfill + LIVE daemon (10/10, `getStatus().serverUp===true`) — closes the gap the first pass missed. Only the Electron-GUI relaunch (serverUp:true in application-*.log) remains for human confirmation.

- prior_root_cause (still true, part of the chain): `getStatus().serverUp` is computed by `_probeVersion()` (local-model.manager.js:146,216-228), which probes the daemon with the **ambient global `fetch`**. In the Electron **main process**, that global `fetch` is Chromium-`net`-backed and FAILS for the loopback Ollama daemon — whereas Node's `http` transport reaches the same daemon fine. So a running, HTTP-reachable daemon is reported `serverUp:false`, which blocks Continue. This is NOT a binary-PATH problem and NOT "serverUp probes the binary" — those parts of the original hypothesis are eliminated below.
- proof: application-2026-07-14.log 17:56:15 "Local model manager started" logs `state:'adopted', adopted:true` (the supervisor's Node-`http` `probeHttp` to 127.0.0.1:11434 SUCCEEDED → it adopted the running daemon) **and** `serverUp:false` in the SAME object / same instant / same process. Two probes to the same host at the same moment: Node `http` succeeds, global `fetch` fails.
- test: RED regression test added — test/local-model-manager.test.js test #8 ("getStatus().serverUp stays true when the daemon is HTTP-reachable but global fetch is broken"). Network-free: real loopback `http` daemon + `globalThis.fetch` stubbed to throw (faithful proxy for the Electron-main condition). Confirmed **RED** against current code: `false !== true` at test:287.
- next_action: DONE — [GREEN] applied: `_probeVersion()` now probes `/api/version` via `ServiceSupervisor.probeHttp` (Node `http`), dropping the global-`fetch` dependency. Regression test #8 flipped RED→GREEN; both whole-repo gates green (`node --test test/*.test.js` 84/84; `npx eslint .` clean). Fix+test+debug-file committed atomically (explicit pathspec). See ## Resolution.

## Evidence

- timestamp: 2026-07-14 — Daemon IS reachable: `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/version` and `/api/tags` both return HTTP 200. So "Not running" is a FALSE negative.
- timestamp: 2026-07-14 — Onboarding gate: the ollama screen's "not found" (onboarding.js:504) AND "Not running" pill (onboarding.js:505) are BOTH set from one value — `state.ollamaDetected = !!s.serverUp`, `s = getModelStatus()` (onboarding.js:492-493); `canAdvance('ollama')` returns `state.ollamaDetected` (onboarding.js:165). IPC `get-model-status` → `LocalModelManager.getStatus()` (main.js:809-815).
- timestamp: 2026-07-14 — `_probeVersion()` is ALREADY a pure HTTP probe to `this.host` (`fetch(\`${host}/api/version\`)`, local-model.manager.js:216-228); it does NOT touch the binary. So "make serverUp a pure HTTP probe" was already true — the defect is the fetch TRANSPORT, not a spawn/PATH check.
- timestamp: 2026-07-14 — SMOKING GUN: application-2026-07-14.log 17:56:15 — `Local model manager started { state:'adopted', adopted:true, serverUp:false, ... }`. The supervisor's `probeHttp` (Node `http`) adopted the daemon at the same instant `_probeVersion` (global `fetch`) returned false. Same host, same moment, opposite results ⇒ transport-specific failure.
- timestamp: 2026-07-14 — Transport diff: `ServiceSupervisor.probeHttp` uses `http.get` (service-supervisor.js:59-68); `_probeVersion` uses the global `fetch` (local-model.manager.js:221). Electron's main-process global `fetch` is Chromium-`net`-backed and fails for loopback where Node `http` works — the classic Electron-main fetch gotcha.
- timestamp: 2026-07-14 — Live repro (daemon up): under system node v26 AND `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` (Electron's Node v20, pure **undici** — NOT the Chromium-net path) with full PATH, `_probeVersion()`=true, `getStatus().serverUp`=true, `ollamaBin=/opt/homebrew/bin/ollama`. The bug does NOT reproduce in pure-Node undici; it is specific to the full Electron main process's Chromium-net `fetch` — consistent with the on-device log.
- timestamp: 2026-07-14 — Secondary (NOT the gate): earlier 07-14 entries (15:48–16:39) logged `reason:'not-installed', installed:false` from `start()` (ollamaBin null). The onboarding gate is `serverUp` from `getStatus()` (not `start()`), and the 17:56 run resolved the binary (adopted) yet STILL reported `serverUp:false` — so the fetch-transport defect is the real, persistent blocker independent of binary resolution. Fixing `_probeVersion` also flips both ollama-screen labels (both read `serverUp`). Binary-resolve hardening is therefore out of scope for the minimal fix.
- timestamp: 2026-07-14 — Test seams (network-free): `test/local-model-manager.test.js` injects fake `ollama`/`supervisor`/`spawn` via constructor DI and stubs `manager._probeVersion`; the new test #8 instead runs the REAL `_probeVersion` against a loopback `http` server with `globalThis.fetch` stubbed to throw — proving `serverUp` must not depend on the global fetch.
- timestamp: 2026-07-14T23:04 — REOPEN-2 session-manager verification (REAL polyfill + LIVE daemon): ran the FIXED code in plain Node with the REAL `require('src/services/speech.service')` loaded (not a stub) against the live daemon (127.0.0.1:11434, HTTP 200). Confirmed the real polyfill poisons `global.URL` (`new URL('http://127.0.0.1:11434')` → hostname `"localhost"`, port `""`), that `LocalProvider` constructs with no browser-guard throw, that the manager constructor repairs `global.URL` to native, and — DECISIVE — `_probeVersion()===true` AND `getStatus().serverUp===true` under the real polyfill. 10/10 checks pass. This is the exact condition the first pass missed.

## Eliminated

- ELIMINATED — "serverUp is gated on resolving/spawning the ollama binary via PATH." `getStatus().serverUp` calls `_probeVersion()`, a pure HTTP probe that never touches the binary. Proven by the 17:56 log (binary resolved → adopted) where serverUp was still false.
- ELIMINATED — "macOS GUI/Electron reduced PATH is the gate cause." The reduced PATH only affects `_resolveOllamaBin` (which/where); `fs.existsSync` fallbacks resolve `/opt/homebrew/bin/ollama` regardless of PATH, and the 17:56 run adopted the daemon with the binary resolved — yet serverUp stayed false. The blocker is the fetch transport, not PATH.
- ELIMINATED — proxy/host env redirection (`OLLAMA_BASE_URL`/`HTTP(S)_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY` all unset); wrong host (config resolves `http://127.0.0.1:11434`); `/api/version` path (curl + undici repro both 200); IPv6/`localhost` resolution (host is literal IPv4 `127.0.0.1`).

## Resolution

- root_cause: `getStatus().serverUp` came from `_probeVersion()` (local-model.manager.js:216-228), which probed `${host}/api/version` with the **ambient global `fetch`**. In the Electron **main** process that global `fetch` is Chromium-`net`-backed and returns a false negative for the loopback Ollama daemon, whereas Node's `http` transport reaches the same daemon fine. Proof: application-2026-07-14.log 17:56:15 logged `state:'adopted', adopted:true` (supervisor Node-`http` `probeHttp` succeeded) **and** `serverUp:false` in the same object/instant/process. Both onboarding labels ("not found" + "Not running" pill, onboarding.js:504-505) and the Continue gate (`canAdvance('ollama')`, onboarding.js:165) are driven by that single boolean, so the false negative blocked Continue.
- fix: Rewrote `_probeVersion()` to probe `/api/version` over Node `http` via `ServiceSupervisor.probeHttp` — the same deterministic transport the supervisor already uses to adopt the daemon — dropping the global-`fetch` dependency. Parses `this.host` with `URL` for host/port, keeps it timeout-bounded (`timeoutMs`, default 1000), and stays graceful (returns `false` on any error). No unrelated code touched. Fixing this one method flips both ollama-screen labels and the Continue gate, since all read `serverUp`.
- verification:
  - RED→GREEN: `node --test test/local-model-manager.test.js` — test #8 "getStatus().serverUp stays true when the daemon is HTTP-reachable but global fetch is broken" (real loopback `http` daemon + `globalThis.fetch` stubbed to throw) now PASSES; was failing `false !== true` at test:287 before the fix. All 9 tests in the file pass.
  - Whole-repo gate 1: `node --test test/*.test.js` → 84 tests, 84 pass, 0 fail.
  - Whole-repo gate 2: `npx eslint .` → exit 0, clean (`URL` is a Node global; `ServiceSupervisor` already imported; `catch (_)` exempt).
- files_changed (prior pass, commit 2628f8a — necessary but INSUFFICIENT):
  - src/core/local-model.manager.js — `_probeVersion()` now uses `ServiceSupervisor.probeHttp` (Node `http`) instead of the global `fetch`.
  - test/local-model-manager.test.js — added regression test #8 (RED→GREEN) proving `serverUp` must not depend on the global fetch.

## Resolution (REOPEN 2 — deeper root cause: Azure browser-DOM polyfill poisons global.URL)

- why_prior_fix_insufficient: commit 2628f8a switched `_probeVersion` to Node `http` but still parsed `this.host` with the **global** `URL`. The Azure STT polyfill (speech.service.js, required at main.js top-level) had already REPLACED `global.URL` with a fake that parses every input to `{hostname:'localhost', port:'', protocol:'https:'}` (speech.service.js:293-308, assigned at :354). So probeHttp targeted `localhost:443`, not `127.0.0.1:11434` → serverUp:false persisted after a clean restart. The SAME poison ALSO threw inside the openai SDK's `buildURL` (`Object.fromEntries(url.searchParams)`) and mangled the ollama client's `formatHost` (`https://localhost:443…`). Independently, the polyfill's window+document+navigator triad tripped the openai SDK browser guard → `new OpenAI()` threw "browser-like environment" on EVERY run (100% of LOCAL errors in ~/.OpenCluely/logs/error-2026-07-14.log) → isInitialized:false → the LLM could not answer at all (the real 03-07 gate).

- root_cause (deeper, PROVEN network-free): a single process-wide defect — the Azure polyfill clobbering `global.URL` — breaks all three local-engine consumers (`_probeVersion`, openai SDK `buildURL`, ollama `formatHost`), and its window/document/navigator triad additionally trips the openai browser guard.

- fix:
  - NEW src/core/local-transport.js — shared robustness layer: (a) `ensureNativeGlobalURL()` restores the native node:url `URL` to `globalThis.URL` (idempotent; the fake's constant-garbage output cannot be relied on by Azure, so a full WHATWG URL is strictly safe); (b) `nodeFetch()` — a WHATWG-fetch over Node `http`/`https` that parses hosts with the NATIVE URL and returns a native `Response` (web-stream body: supports openai `.json()`/streamed `.body.getReader()` and the ollama client), immune to the Electron-main Chromium-net fetch that false-negatives loopback; (c) `normalizeHeaders()` (the SDK passes a WHATWG `Headers` instance — handed raw to node:http it would silently drop Content-Type/Authorization).
  - src/core/local-model.manager.js — import native `URL` from `node:url` (so `_probeVersion` is immune regardless of load order); call `ensureNativeGlobalURL()` at the top of the constructor before building the ollama client; pass `fetch: nodeFetch` to the ollama client (list/pull/generate/warmup robust); GUARD `getStatus()` so a downstream model-probe throw can never flip `serverUp` false.
  - src/services/providers/local.provider.js — call `ensureNativeGlobalURL()` before constructing the client; add `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` (false-positive browser guard in Electron main) AND `fetch: nodeFetch` (Node transport); route the diagnostics `_fetchWithTimeout` through `nodeFetch` too.
  - Polyfill LEFT INTACT (removal is Phase 4 / STT-05); the local engine is made robust against it.

- tests (TDD RED→GREEN, network-free / loopback only):
  - test/local-model-manager.test.js #9 "getStatus().serverUp stays true when the Azure polyfill has poisoned global.URL" — poisons `globalThis.URL` with a faithful FakeBrowserURL AFTER construction, asserts serverUp:true against a real loopback daemon. RED pre-fix: `AssertionError: a reachable daemon must be serverUp even under a poisoned global URL` (false). GREEN post-fix.
  - test/local-model-manager.test.js #10 "getStatus() keeps serverUp true when a downstream model probe throws" — RED pre-fix: getStatus rejected (`Error: model probe blew up`); GREEN post-fix (serverUp:true, modelPresent:false).
  - test/local-provider.test.js "client initializes under the polyfilled globals and the poisoned global URL is repaired" — sets the openai isRunningInBrowser triad + poisoned URL, asserts `isAvailable()===true` and `globalThis.URL===require('node:url').URL`. RED pre-fix: `AssertionError: client must initialize under polyfilled globals (dangerouslyAllowBrowser)` — `false !== true` (test:182). GREEN post-fix.
  - NEW test/local-transport.test.js — 6 tests locking in `ensureNativeGlobalURL()` + `nodeFetch()` (json, streamed getReader, Headers normalization, native-URL-under-poison) + `normalizeHeaders()`.

- verification (gates):
  - Gate 1: `node --test test/*.test.js` → 93 tests, 93 pass, 0 fail (was 84; +9 new).
  - Gate 2: `npx eslint .` → exit 0, clean.

- verification (REOPEN-2 session-manager — REAL polyfill + LIVE daemon, the condition the first pass missed): ran the FIXED code (commit 7b4a48a) in plain Node with the REAL `require('src/services/speech.service')` polyfill loaded (NOT a stub) against the live Ollama daemon (127.0.0.1:11434, HTTP 200). 10/10 checks pass: (1) real polyfill poisons `global.URL` — `new URL('http://127.0.0.1:11434')` → hostname `"localhost"`, port `""` (reproduces the decisive evidence exactly); (2) `LocalProvider` constructs with NO browser-guard throw under the polyfilled globals; (3) `LocalModelManager` constructor repairs `global.URL` to native; (4) DECISIVE — `_probeVersion()===true` AND `getStatus().serverUp===true` against the live daemon under the real polyfill. Confirms the code fix resolves the exact failing condition; the residual full Electron-main Chromium-net GUI path is specifically neutralized by the `nodeFetch` transport.

- verification (REAL FULL APP): PENDING human confirmation. Requires a FULL quit + relaunch (dev `npm start`) with the Ollama daemon running, then `serverUp:true` in ~/.OpenCluely/logs/application-*.log AND no "browser-like environment" / URL errors in error-*.log, plus onboarding Step 3 unblocking Continue and the local model answering. Agent cannot drive the Electron GUI; the REOPEN-2 node check above is the strongest non-GUI proxy. The separate onActivate crash at main.js:1534 was left untouched (out of scope).

- files_changed (REOPEN 2, commit 7b4a48a):
  - src/core/local-transport.js (NEW)
  - src/core/local-model.manager.js
  - src/services/providers/local.provider.js
  - test/local-transport.test.js (NEW)
  - test/local-model-manager.test.js
  - test/local-provider.test.js
